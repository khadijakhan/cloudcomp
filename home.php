	<h4>Main Repository:</h4><p> Repository consists of cloud goals, obstacles and tactics.</p>
	<br/>
	<h4>Cloud goals: </h4><p>These are the functional and non-functional requirements coming from different stakeholders specific to cloud adoption. Click here to access the list of identified goals.</p>
	<h4>Cloud risks: </h4><p> We likened the risks to obtacles encountered while realizing cloud user goals. Click here to access the list of obstacle. </p>
	<h4>Cloud tactics: </h4><p>These are cloud-specific obstacle resolution tactics for mitigating identified risks. Click here to access the list of tactics. </p>
	<h4> Evidence </h4> <p> This table presents the list of all empirical studies that have been reviewed so far for identifying goals in adopting cloud services, potential obstacles, and resolution tactics to resolve obstacles. Click here to access the table of studies that reports such evidence.<p>
	<h4>How this repository has been developed? </h4>
	<p>The repository has cloud-specific goals, obstacles/risks, and tactics.</p>
	<h4>How to read this repository?</h4>
		<p>The repository requires users to select any cloud specific goals. Once they submit their goals, the obstacles specific to the goals will be displayed. 
		The user then needs to identify the obstacles he/she would like to resolve. Once obstable are identified, selected and submitted; different tactics for resolving those obstacles will be displayed. The user will select any tactic to mitigate the risk(s). Finally, a table will be generated mapping user goals with obstacles and tactics.<p>
